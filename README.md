### CodeAlpha Internship: Data Science Projects

## Overview

This repository contains four data science projects completed for a CodeAlpha internship, demonstrating skills in classification, regression, and time-series analysis. The tasks include Iris flower classification, unemployment rate analysis, car price prediction, and sales prediction, using Python libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels).

## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

## Objective: Classify Iris species using Iris.csv.

## Dataset: 150 rows, features: SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm, target: Species.

## Methodology:

1. Cleaned data, fixed visualization error.
2. Visualized with pairplots and boxplots.
3. Trained Logistic Regression (~93% accuracy) and Decision Tree (~90%).

## Insights: Petal features are key; useful for plant identification.

## Code: Iris.ipynb




## Task 3: Car Price Prediction

## Objective: Predict car prices using carData.csv.

## Dataset: 301 rows, features: Year, Present_Price, Driven_kms, Fuel_Type, Selling_type, Transmission, Owner, Brand, target: Selling_Price.

## Methodology:

1. Engineered Age and Brand.
2. Trained Linear Regression (MAE ~1.20 lakhs, R² ~0.85).
3. Visualized actual vs. predicted prices.

## Insights: Helps pricing for buyers/sellers; could use Random Forest.

## Task 4: Sales Prediction

## Objective: Predict sales based on advertising using Advertising.csv.

## Dataset: 200 rows, features: TV, Radio, Newspaper, target: Sales.

## Methodology:

1. Cleaned data, scaled features.
2. Trained Linear Regression (MAE ~1.25, R² ~0.90).
3. Analyzed advertising impact (TV strongest).

## Insights: Prioritize TV advertising; test targeted campaigns.

## Code: salesPrediction.ipynb

## Tools

## Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels

## Environment: Python 3.13, Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
These projects showcase data preprocessing, modeling, and visualization skills, addressing applications in botany, economics, automotive, and marketing. The code is simple and ready for internship submission.
